# Live-Stream-TL
Currently configured for translating audio captured from your computer from JP to EN in real-time, though it works with any VOSK model. 

Requires an OpenAI API key, as well as a local VOSK speech recognition model. 
Make sure `main.py` is located in the same directory as your model. Additionally, you should have a `.env` file with your API key under the variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. 

Originally developed for watching Hololive JP streams.
